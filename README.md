# To-Do Using React Native

In this project we have App.tsx which is the main file and import the component (./src/Dashboard.js).
## Dashboard.js 

Dashboard.js is is the file which we are going to see on the screen, it import List.js and Component.js (./___).\
We used the concept of Conditional Rendering to render Two files on screen using useState.

## List.js 
This is responsible to display the To-Do list on the screen.

## ListComponent.js 
This is responsible to display the clicked item in To-Do list.
